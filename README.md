# Movie-library-repo
Create a movie library web application with the below features using any tech stack of your choice -
The application must have user authentication ( Sign In/ Sign Up )
After logging in users will be navigated to the home screen where they should see a search option where they can search movies and see details of those movies. 
They can create a list of movies by adding the movies to lists. ( Similar to youtube playlists ). On the home page, different movie lists created by that user will be displayed.
These lists can be either public ( anyone with a link to the list can see this ) or private ( only the person who created can see this list )
You can use OMDB API for the movie search option.
The Search & List page should have a nice layout, take inspiration from other websites/applications.
Include Steps to run ( Readme file ) in the project as well.
You must host their projects online and provide working links of the application as well as code. ( e.g. Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, JSBin etc. )
